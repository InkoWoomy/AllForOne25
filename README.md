This project uses an API with unique endpoints to create 10 individual pages with a prompt to give and a response to return.

“Nice simple design. Validation would be nice for add two numbers  and asking question, so that you dont just get an error response when you type in like a string when you are looking for an int. You do have validation in some of your other ones like odd or even and reverse it. Greater than less than is not working, its not doing anything when i put two numbers in. madlib could use a bit of padding/margin for the entry field so that its not on the edge but thats a bit more minor, also the menu button does sometimes block the text depending on screen size. Everything else looks fine.”
